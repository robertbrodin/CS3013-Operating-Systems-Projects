Programmed by Robert Brodin, A Term 2020-2021, for CS3013 (Operating Systems), with Professor Wills.
The homework assignment consists of three parts, part one is to write a program to run a given command in terminal.
Part two is to build a custom shell to run three custom commands and all other commands. The three custom commands are cd, set prompt, and exit.
Part three is to make processes run in the background. I got about halfway through part three, which was frustrating. I hope that you will at least consider giving me maybe a half a point,
because I have the framework pretty much there (in keeping track of jobs), I just couldn't finish process communication in time.

How my shell compares to regular shell:
For one, it is obviously less complex and has less capability than a normal shell. In addition, my shell for some reason glitches out when running commands such as a ; b, or a | b. 
I could easily add functionality for this in the future, but alas, I did not have the time or mental energy.
